Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.

The goal of this assignment is to predict how well a participant performs a bicep curl based on data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.They were each asked to perform the exercise in five different ways. Classe A corresponds to the correct way of doing the exercise, while the other 4 Classes (B, C, D, ands E) correspond to common mistakes. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts Classe. The final output of the assignment is a set of predictions that we will use to complete the Week 3 Quiz.
